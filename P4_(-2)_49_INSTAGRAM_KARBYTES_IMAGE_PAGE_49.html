<p><strong><em>While I agree with the quote depicted in the Instagram screenshot below within the context of colloquial socializing as a human with my fellow humans as a <u>humanist</u> (i.e. one who believes that each human deserves the same basic unconditional commodities and freedoms), my <u>transhumanist</u> sensibilities tell me that artificial intelligence (and other forms of non-human or human-derived information processing agents) have the power to override human nervous systems (and a transhumanist is one who condones that human beings have the opportunity to technologically augment themselves to attain greater health, abilities, and knowledge). If a small group of oligarchs (e.g. &#8220;the one percent&#8221;) is able to control most of the nervous systems of the human population, then that small group of oligarchs has almost totalitarian power over the entire human population. Sincerity of intent to band together as underdogs is not sufficient to address the deeper reality of human nervous systems being hijacked by brain-to-computer interfacing technology (and the military may be the first and last to have such technologies at its disposal). Businesses outside of government need to keep pioneering brain-to-computer interfaces for that reason: to prevent the government from monopolizing that domain of expertise and influence (i.e. the domain pertaining to the continued development and refinement of neural prosthetics and brain-to-computer interfaces).</em></strong></p>
