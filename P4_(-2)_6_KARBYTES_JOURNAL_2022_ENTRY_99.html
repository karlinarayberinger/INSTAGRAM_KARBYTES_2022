<p>While browsing Minds dot Com today, I came across a meme which complained about how freeloaders are being treated better than tax payers. (The user who posted that meme also posted a meme about preferring to elect blue collar industrial workers over Yale and Harvard graduates as political leaders).</p>
<p>I think that most people would agree that I am a freeloader because (a) I do not have a paid job and (b) I leach money from my parents (not by stealing, of course, but in the form of donations).</p>
<p>If the government ends up &#8220;wasting&#8221; my tax dollars on expanding the fossil fuels production and hyper militarization instead of radically shifting from fossil fuels dependence to sustainable energy sources, funding more social services, and building cheaper, more environmentally friendly houses for the homeless and the poor, then it seems that being unemployed and spending all of my time being a student and artist is not more wasteful than working as some corporate drone at some company where my talents are essentially wasted in exchange for being able to rightfully call myself a tax paying citizen.</p>
<p>Eventually, I do hope to get a &#8220;real job&#8221;. The best job I had so far was working as a software developer and technical writer student intern at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory&#8217;s Information Technology Collaboration Services department. I was paid $13.65 per hour and my working hours were flexible. I was allowed to work from home and to come into the office as I preferred (and when I entered my working hours for the week into a web form on Friday to submit to the payroll office, I was trusted to put in accurate numbers). I was trusted to &#8220;do the right thing&#8221; rather than be treated like a delinquent before I did anything wrong like how I was at &#8220;more lowly&#8221; jobs such as cashiering, warehouse assembly line, and kitchen duty.</p>
<p>I have had a hard time swallowing the following trend to my experiences: working class Hispanics have been particularly intrusive, controlling, and antagonistic towards me for simply wanting to stay relatively &#8220;white collar&#8221; instead of &#8220;blue collar&#8221;. I have felt hijacked and stolen from by such people and forced to play their mascot and scapegoat for years. It&#8217;s been a &#8220;no win&#8221; situation from my end: no matter what I do, I end up pissing off the working class pygmies who treat me like a piece of livestock they own and who owes them servitude at the expense of personal freedom. If I worked for them, they teased me and were generally unfriendly towards me. If I did not work for them, they seemed to follow me out to wherever I was trying to build a little life for myself to spoil my solitude so that I would be forced to stomp home and hide inside (and that is not a good option because I desperately crave that kind of solitude which I can only get by spending days at a time outdoors).</p>
<p>Please do not take what I say too seriously. I did not mean to single out Hispanics or even working class people in general as bullies. I have seen &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221; examples of human in all demographics. I just have had a bit more difficulty with some types of people than others. (I will just throw in this little factoid which I heard while watching the CNN news one night at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic: the birth rate of whites, blacks, and Asians declined while the birth rate of Hispanics increased during the pandemic. To me, that is a sign that Hispanics resort to &#8220;shut up and fuck&#8221; as a way to cope with global disasters).</p>
<p>As I am writing this note (and many times when my mind goes from waiting for a chance to let loose and get intensely analytical and verbose), I hear other people in the background through the noise app which I listen to in order to mask the sound of other people&#8217;s voices barking in a scolding manner. I have come to the conclusion that other people are hyper vigilant about what I do with my mind and feel the need to act like tyrannical, micro managerial thought police towards me in particular.</p>
<p>I think this is all related to a cultural trend I have watched subtly (or not so subtly) unfold over the past decade. While I was working at Lawrence Berkeley Lab, the work-based learning program at Las Positas College which enabled me to get hired at LBL was getting defunded in order to fund a childcare center instead. To be clear, the LaPTechS (Las Positas Technical Support) program I worked for as a technical associate and then as a student mentor was getting shut down so that students with young children would get support instead (and LaPTechS was a PC repair shop and accredited college course). The kinds of &#8220;voice of God&#8221; voices I hear inside of my head are seemingly designed to cut me off from thinking about philosophical and/or scientific concepts in favor of bickering incessantly with personalities who seem to want to make me feel ganged up on, raped into submission, infantilized, feminized, and practically forced to be a stay at home mother in training. (Honestly, I think the &#8220;voice of God&#8221; voices I hear are really an intelligence test and deterrent from caving into the &#8220;dumb and dumber&#8221;, &#8220;give birth or be tortured&#8221; cultural propagandic brainwashing which has become more prevalent in the United States of America than it was ten years ago. It is very easy to be bullied into settling for being some kind of whimpering, pouting bitch in a corner who does little more than mind her manners and obsess over the welfare of her little brood of biological spawn which she is practically forced to give birth to and remain tethered to in order to &#8220;earn her keep&#8221; by proving that she is not as self centered as she would be as a single and childless adult (and that she hardly has a minute of free time (which makes her easy to predict, corner, and control)).</p>
<p>As fucked up as this may sound, I am glad that several states in my country have (at least temporarily) banned abortions. The kinds of protests and media backlashes that have arisen as a result of the abortion ban reveal to me some ugly truths about American women: how much they expect to be waited on just for having sex and how abstinence and seriously effective contraceptives are rarely talked about. I see plenty of bitches acting as though condoms are the only contraceptives on the market. That is why I have made an effort to promote the non-hormonal InterUterine Device I have been using for almost a decade. Not only does that IUD not force my body to think that it is perpetually pregnant (because that is what birth control pills essentially do: release unnaturally high amounts of estrogen and progesterone into the body in order to cause that body to not ovulate because that body already thinks it has a fertilized egg in utero), the IUD is over 99% effective and only has to be replaced once every seven years or so. Also, as soon as the device is removed from the uterus, that uterus is back to being fertile as it was before. I am disappointed that so few people seem to be aware of such facts. They seem to just give into what &#8220;the patriarchy&#8221; wants: keeping women &#8220;crazy&#8221;, &#8220;lazy&#8221;, &#8220;knocked up&#8221;, insecure, and always gambling with their bodies and acting like pregnancy is inevitable rather than wholly preventable.</p>
<p>This has been a very refreshing journal to write. Today has been a pleasant day. Earlier this morning, I drew a picture of a decision tree to add to the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/many_worlds_hypothesis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MANY_WORLDS_HYPOTHESIS</a> page of my primary website. Then I fell asleep and had some vivid dreams which were more entertaining than anything I have experienced &#8220;in real life&#8221; or through the entertainment industry. My dreams seem to be showing me that I have a job to do: building bridges between the waking world and parallel universes which I seem to be able to visit by entering altered states of consciousness. I think it is possible to build a website which is accessible from within more than one universe. Perhaps I can make a website which keeps track of where I go from one lifetime to the next.</p>
<p>As I write about my dreams, the thought police usually start to get irritable and distracting. They do not seem to like it when I focus on introspection and esoteric subjects which are not about being infantilized and bullied into social conformity. What is particularly irritating to me is that white, stay at home mom, uneducated Christian bitch keeps softly cooing in a plaintive manner and saying rude, petulant, and petty things to me. She seems more immature than I imagine many children are in more scientifically literate parts of the world are. With her, everything revolves around poo poo and pee pee, tepid martyrdom, rigid gender roles, fear-based ontologies and ethics, and militant anti intellectualism. &#8220;She&#8221; whines, whimpers, hisses, and complains incessantly while ignoring what I have to say. She does not answer questions, she repeats herself often, she uses vague and very small range of seemingly canned phrases, and seems designed to suppress my ingenuity and happiness because she is desperate to keep me from leaving her. She seems desperate to keep me embroiled in fighting with her over filibuster issues. She seems to be a &#8220;lose lose&#8221; type of person. She is profoundly unhappy with her life. Therefore, she is hellbent on dragging me down into her isolationist, infantilizing despair bubble with her so that she does not have to feel so alone. If I could kill her quickly and painlessly and not be persecuted for it, I would not hesitate to do so.</p>
